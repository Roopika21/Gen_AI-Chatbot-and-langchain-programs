# Gen_AI-Day-3
Chatbot Project
This project is a simple chatbot built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates how to create an interactive chatbot that can engage with users through text-based conversations. The chatbot logic is written in Python, and Jupyter Notebook is used for showcasing the development process and testing the chatbot's responses.

Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses basic NLP techniques to understand and respond to user input.
Interactive Chat: Responds to user queries with predefined or dynamic responses.
Customizable Responses: Modify or expand the chatbot's responses easily within the code.
Jupyter Notebook Interface: Easy-to-follow, step-by-step implementation of the chatbot.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used to build the chatbot.
Jupyter Notebook: For coding, testing, and demonstrating the chatbot's functionality.
NLP Libraries (Optional): Uses libraries like nltk or spaCy for advanced text processing.
