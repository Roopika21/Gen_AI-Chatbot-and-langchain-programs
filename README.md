Chatbot Project
This project is a simple chatbot built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates how to create an interactive chatbot that can engage with users through text-based conversations. The chatbot logic is written in Python, and Jupyter Notebook is used for showcasing the development process and testing the chatbot's responses.

Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses basic NLP techniques to understand and respond to user input.
Interactive Chat: Responds to user queries with predefined or dynamic responses.
Customizable Responses: Modify or expand the chatbot's responses easily within the code.
Jupyter Notebook Interface: Easy-to-follow, step-by-step implementation of the chatbot.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used to build the chatbot.
Jupyter Notebook: For coding, testing, and demonstrating the chatbot's functionality.
NLP Libraries (Optional): Uses libraries like nltk or spaCy for advanced text processing.

Leaf Health Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting whether a leaf is healthy or diseased using machine learning models. The project is implemented in Python and demonstrated through a Jupyter Notebook. The model analyzes leaf images and classifies them as healthy or diseased based on image processing and machine learning techniques.

Features
Image Classification: Classifies leaf images into "healthy" or "diseased" categories.
Machine Learning Models: Implements machine learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition.
Data Preprocessing: Includes image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Interactive Jupyter Notebook: Step-by-step demonstration of data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language for building the model.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and visualization.
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch: Used for building and training the image classification model.
OpenCV/PIL: For image preprocessing and handling.
Scikit-learn: For evaluating the performance of the models.

Installation
